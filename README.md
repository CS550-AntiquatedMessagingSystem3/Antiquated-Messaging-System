## Antiquated-Messaging-System

This project is introducing the antiquated messaging system. There are three methods of antiquated messenging presented in this project: the morse code, the pigeon carrier, and the encryption system. With morse code, the inputs, which are in the english alphabet, are converted to morse code. The conversions to morse code will be searched from Google. Regarding the encryption system, the user can choose the input and how much alphabets to shift. After putting the input, the output will be printed out secured with the encryption system. The pigeon messanger takes user message input (and custom # of flaps), and shows a pigeon flapping its wings and flying, then returns the original message after the visual. All these three messangers are considered antique, however it is still well respected currently. 

Siri did the morse code and made the main function to work for the group. Kevin had done the encryption system. Kevin and Rohin wrote the summaries and descriptions for this README file. Rohin had done the pigeon carrier messenger system. Our group attempted to use our time wisely and worked out during every class time we had. Please enjoy our antiquated messaging system!
