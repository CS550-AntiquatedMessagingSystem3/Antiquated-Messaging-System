## Antiquated-Messaging-System

This project is introducing the antiquated messaging system. There are three messengers presented in this project: the morse code, the pigeon messanger, and the encryption system. With morse code, the inputs, which are in alphabets, will be converted to the morse code. The conversions to morse code will be searched from Google. Regarding encryption system, the user can choose the input and how much alphabets to shift. After putting the input, the output will be printed out secured with the encryption system. The pigeon messanger will show of how based on the user's input, the pigeon will be jumping, while flapping the wing. All these three messangers are considered antique, however it is still well respected currently. 

Siri did the morse code and made the main function to work for the group. Kevin had done the encryption system and wrote the descriptions for the README file. Rohin had done the pigeon messenger. Our group attempted to use our time wisely and worked out during every class time we had. Please enjoy our antiquated messaging system!
